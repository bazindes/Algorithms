第一題：
Assume you are playing a card game in which each card has a cost and a damage caused to your opponent.
Write a function:. Waral 博客有更多文章,
class Solution . Waral 博客有更多文章,
{
      public boolean Solution (int total_money, int total_damage , int[] costs, int[] damages){}
}

that given:

integer total_money : total money you have
integer total_damage : total damage to be caused
array costs of integers (size N) : the cost of every card
array damages of integers (size N) : the damage caused to your opponent by every card


should return true if it is possible to cause at least total_damage amount of damage to your opponent using
a maximum of total_money units of money, or false otherwise. Each card can be selected only once.


For example, given total_money = 5, total_damage = 3, costs = [4,5,1] and damages = [1,2,3] your function
should return true. You can scause at least total_damage amount of damage to your opponent using a
maximum of total_money units of money in 2 different ways:

By selecting the third card whose cost is 1 and damage is 3.
By selecting the first and third card whose cost are (4,1) and damage caused to another player are (1,3).留学论坛-一亩-三分地

It is possible to cause at least 3 units of damage to your opponent, therefore, ther answer is true.

Assume that:


N, total_money and total_damage are integers within the range [1..1,000]
each element of arrrays costs, damages is an integer within the range [1...1,000]

第二題：
Write a function:
class Solution
{. more info on 1point3acres
      public int solution(String S, String T) {}
}. From 1point 3acres bbs


that, given a string S and a string T, return 1 if it's possible to convert string S into string T by deleting some(possible zero)
characters from string S, and otherwise returns 0.


For example, given S="abcd" and T="abd" the function should return 1. We can delete 'c' from string S to convert string S into 来源一亩.三分地论坛.
string T. However, given S="ab" and T="ba" the function should return 0.


Assume that:
the length of ('S' , 'T') is within the range [1..1,000]
strings S and T consist only of lower-case letters (a-z).
